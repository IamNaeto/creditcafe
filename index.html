            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>Our card details are randomly generated using the Luhn (MOD 10) algorithm. All real credit cards follow this algorithm, they have fixed prefixes and can be easily identified (i.e VISA cards always start with a '4'). If you want to learn more about how the Luhn checksum formula works then check out an indepth breakdown. To try our tool, simply Create your account for free, select a credit card design of your choose, generate your card code and download your card to your user account.</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <h4>What is a credit card generator? <img src="img/Plus-icon 1.png" alt="" class="plus one-plus" >
            <span><br /> A  credit card generator creates valid credit card numbers that can be used for software data testing and other verification purposes. They cannot be used to purchase anything.</span></h4>
            <h4>How does a credit card generator work? <img src="img/Plus-icon 1.png" alt="" class="plus two-plus">
            <span><br /> Credit cards follow a specific format known as the Luhn algorithm (MOD 10). Each credit card issuer like VISA have their own prefixes. A credit card generator uses the Luhn checksum to create a valid card number.</span></h4>
            <h4>Can I buy items with these credit card numbers? <img src="img/Plus-icon 1.png" alt="" class="plus three-plus">
            <span><br />No, generated credit card numbers can only be used for software testing and education purposes. They will NOT work if you try to purchase anything.</span></h4>
            <h4>Do you offer any credit card numbers that have money on them? <img src="img/Plus-icon 1.png" alt="" class="plus four-plus">
            <span><br />No, we do not offer any credit cards that have money on them. There are a number of online banks such as Revolut & Starling Bank which offer virtual credit & debit cards. Our card numbers are for programming and verification purposes only.</span></h4>
            <h4>What does CVV mean? <img src="img/Plus-icon 1.png" alt="" class="plus five-plus">
            <span><br />The CVV Number ("Card Verification Value") is a 3 digit number on VISA, MasterCard and Discover credit/debit cards. On American Express cards it is a 4 digit numeric code. It is used in credit and debit cards for the purpose of verifying the owner's identity & reducing the risk of fraud. The CVV is also known as the card verification code (CVC) or card security code (CSC).</span></h4>
